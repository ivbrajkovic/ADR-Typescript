# Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

## ADR-002: Adopting TypeScript as Primary Language for Development (Extended)

Date: 2023-07-02

### Status

Proposed

### Context

We are developing complex software applications using JavaScript, a flexible, dynamically-typed language. Despite its flexibility, JavaScript poses certain challenges that are becoming more apparent as our applications grow in scale and complexity. These challenges often include unexpected bugs due to type errors, difficulties in managing large codebases, and a lack of strong developer tooling. The absence of static type checking in JavaScript also contributes to more runtime errors, slowing down the development process and negatively affecting the user experience.

### Decision

In light of these challenges, we propose to adopt TypeScript as our primary language for application development.

TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript developed and maintained by Microsoft. It offers static type checking, class-based object-oriented programming, and improved developer tooling, among other features.

### Reasons for the Decision

**1. Enhanced Code Quality and Reliability:**

TypeScript's static typing feature helps to catch errors early in the development process. This helps to improve the quality of code and avoid potential runtime errors. It can ensure that the parameters and returns of functions, as well as the properties of objects, are of the expected types.

**2. Improved Developer Productivity:**

By providing enhanced autocompletion, code navigation, and advanced refactoring capabilities, TypeScript allows developers to write more reliable and robust code faster. Additionally, by catching potential errors at the compile-time, it reduces the amount of time spent on debugging.

**3. Code Scalability and Maintainability:**

TypeScript's support for advanced JavaScript features such as classes, modules, and interfaces makes it a great choice for large-scale applications. It provides a strong foundation for building large, complex systems, and its robust typing system makes the code more readable and maintainable.

**4. Incremental Adoption:**

Since TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, existing JavaScript codebases can be incrementally upgraded to TypeScript. This enables us to gradually improve our codebase without a costly or risky full rewrite.

**5. Growing Community and Ecosystem:**

TypeScript has a vibrant and growing community of developers and is increasingly becoming a standard for web development. More and more third-party libraries provide TypeScript definitions, and it's being adopted by popular frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js. Its consistent growth and widespread adoption suggest that TypeScript is here to stay.

**6. Enhanced Collaboration:**

TypeScript's static typing provides a level of self-documentation for code that makes collaboration between developers easier. This can be particularly beneficial in large teams or open-source projects where developers need to quickly understand and contribute to existing codebases.

**7. Better for Large-Scale Projects:**

TypeScript's ability to handle and organize large amounts of code makes it an excellent choice for larger projects. With support for advanced object-oriented programming concepts like interfaces and generics, TypeScript facilitates more modular and reusable code.

**8. Clear Roadmap and Stable Evolution:**

Backed by Microsoft, TypeScript has a clear development roadmap and regular update cycles. This assures us that the language will continue to evolve, improve, and receive support from one of the largest technology companies in the world.

**9. Supports Latest JavaScript Features:**

TypeScript supports newer ECMAScript standards and transpiles them down to older versions of JavaScript to maintain compatibility. This means we can write code using the latest JavaScript features while ensuring it runs correctly on all platforms.

**10. Integration with Build and Testing Tools:**

TypeScript integrates well with popular JavaScript build tools like Webpack, Babel, and testing libraries like Jest. This means we can continue to use the tools we're familiar with while getting the

 added benefits of TypeScript.

**11. Easy Debugging:**

As TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, it allows the use of existing JavaScript debugging tools. TypeScript source maps allow us to debug the original TypeScript code instead of the transpiled JavaScript, making the debugging process more straightforward.

**12. TypeScript is Future-Proof:**

With its growing popularity, wide-ranging support from Microsoft, and integration with major JavaScript libraries and frameworks, TypeScript is not just a current trend but appears to be a wise investment for future development.

### Consequences

- **Initial learning curve:** TypeScript introduces new concepts and syntax, which may require some time for the team to learn and get comfortable with. However, with appropriate training and resources, this transition can be managed effectively.

- **Additional build step:** TypeScript needs to be transpiled to JavaScript, adding an extra step in the build process. However, this process can be automated with modern build tools, and the benefits of catching errors at compile-time far outweigh the cost of this additional step.

- **Improved codebase management:** TypeScriptâ€™s type annotations serve as in-code documentation, making the codebase more understandable and easier to navigate. This will result in an improvement in maintainability, extensibility, and onboarding of new developers.

- **Early error detection:** By identifying potential errors at compile-time rather than at runtime, TypeScript helps to catch issues early in the development process. This will lead to a more stable, reliable product, improving the end-user experience and potentially reducing the amount of time spent on bug fixes and support.

### Next Steps

If this proposal is accepted, a pilot project will be executed using TypeScript to identify and learn from any challenges that arise during the implementation process. The learnings from this project will be used to develop a roadmap for the gradual adoption of TypeScript across all projects. The results of the pilot project and the proposed roadmap will be presented in a subsequent meeting for further discussion and decision-making.
